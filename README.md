This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## About the app
The application is made with angular 8 and uses [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs/) as store manger. The score is also persisted to the local storage.

The game module is lazily loaded and each cell is a component that gets reused.
